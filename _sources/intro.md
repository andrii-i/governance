# Project Jupyter Governance

The purpose of this documentation is to formalize the governance process that
the IPython/Jupyter project has used informally since its inception in 2001.
This document clarifies how decisions are made and how the various elements
of our community interact, including the relationship between open source
collaborative development and work that may be funded by for-profit or non-profit entities.

```{note}
Currently (as of late 2022), Jupyter's governance is undergoing a transition to a new model described in the "Future Governance" section. A high-level [overview can be found here](overview.md).
```
